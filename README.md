# ðŸš€ Day 1 â€“ React Routing & Jokes API Integration

This is Day 1 of my **7-day backend + frontend revision challenge** where I rebuild important dev tools daily and share my progress.

## ðŸ”¥ What I Built
- A simple React app with **routing** using React Router DOM
- Backend built with Express that serves a **random programming joke**
- Connected frontend and backend using **Fetch API**

- # âœ… Day 2 â€“ Todo API with Express (CRUD)

This is Day 2 of my **7-day backend + frontend revision challenge**. Today I built a full CRUD API using Express and tested it using Postman.

## ðŸ”¥ What I Built
- REST API for managing a list of todos
- Supported Create, Read, Update, Delete operations
- Tested all endpoints in Postman
